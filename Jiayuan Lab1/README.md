Hi! This is the first lab that I did for Geob 472!

Reflective Analysis:

My map mainly focuses on the parks in the City of Vancouver. I am inspired by the pandemic and a project that I did for a statistic course to create this map. During the pandemic, people often engage in less indoor activities and more outdoor activities. Therefore, parks become a popular place for people to take a walk, play their favorite sports and even have a picnic when the weather is nice. Vancouver has a few famous parks such as Stanley Park and the Queen Elizabeth Park that almost every Vancouverites know. These parks can be very crowded especially during summer because of their famousness. As a result, I want my map to address that there are a lot more parks in Vancouver and we should make good use of these public facilities. According to the statistic project that I did, I find out that the neighbourhoods in Vancouver share relatively equal access to the public parks despite difference in housing prices, income level and population density. In other words, almost every Vancouverites has easy access to public parks. Therefore, I think it is meaningful to design an interactive map for residents in the City of Vancouver to explore the nearest parks to them. Since I want to map the parks in Vancouver, the best place to find relevant data is probably the City of Vancouver open data portal. I explored the website and downloaded the GeoJSON file on parks. There are 216 data points in total. 

The dominant color of my map is green because it correlates well to the theme of park and greenspace. Also, I learned from “The Guide to Map Design” that limiting colors on maps “will also help with visual harmony” (20). So instead of using different colors, I used different shades of green to distinguish between different features. I changed the original color of the land into a very light shade of green to increase visual harmony. For the parks, I picked a darker shade of green because I want this feature to stand out from the land feature and at the top of the visual hierarchy. For pitch, I used an even darker color than the color for parks in order to distinguish it from the parks with ease. I chose a very light purple for features such as schools and hospitals so that the greenspaces to stand out. I included some contextual layers such as names of neighbourhoods, cities and roads, city boundaries, and waterbodies. These layers provide information on the location of the parks. Furthermore, I removed irrelevant contexts such as transit labels, airport labels, point of interest icons etc. Considering that the intended audience of this map are residents in Vancouver, it is unnecessary to put emphasis on major roads and highways. So, I lightened the color of these roads on zoom level 11. Moreover, I used a brown tree-shape icon with white stroke for the data points which are the locations of the parks. The white stroke does a good job making the icons stand out from the base map. Since I have removed the point of interest icons, this is the only icon left on the map. By clicking on the tree-shape icons, the name of the park and the neighbourhood name that the park is located will appear in popups. The overall visual effect of the map that I seek is to allow map readers to easily identify parks in Vancouver and provide some basic information of these parks. I think I achieved it by making appropriate changes to the context and adding interactivity to the map.

My map has two zoom levels to help me putting emphasis on what I want to present with my map. One zoom level is 8. On this zoom level, the parks, land and water are in lighter, less saturated colors. On the contrary, the color of highways and other features are more saturated. Features like schools and hospitals are in different colors. Since the data points are all within one city, my map needs to be zoomed in to zoom level 11 in order to view all of them. On this zoom level, the color of the parks, land and water are more saturated and darker. Features other than parks and greenspaces are changed into a very light purple. The opacity of the symbol that represents the data points is higher. This is because I want this zoom level to emphasize on the data points and the important features that provide context to the data. I also take consideration of the concept of color contrast because it can help separate “features from the surrounding elements and can instantly create emphasis and interest” (The Guide to Map Design, 47). On zoom level 11, there is more color contrast between the land and the ocean surrounding the land so that the land and the water features do not blend together. There is also more color contrast between the greenspaces and the land in order to create emphasis on parks.
